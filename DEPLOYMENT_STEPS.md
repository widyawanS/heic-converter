## 🔄 Next Steps (For You)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (5 minutes)
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `heic-converter`
3. Description: `HEIC Image Converter API`
4. Choose "Public"
5. **Don't** initialize with README
6. Click "Create Repository"

### Step 2: Get Repository URL
After creation, copy the URL shown (looks like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/heic-converter.git`)

### Step 3: Tell Me the URL
Once you have the URL, I'll:
- Push code to GitHub
- Setup Heroku deployment
- Get your API live!

## 🚀 What Happens After

Once you give me the GitHub URL:

1. **Push to GitHub** (5 seconds)
   - I'll push all code to your GitHub repository
   - You'll see all files appear on GitHub website

2. **Setup Heroku** (5 minutes)
   - Create a free Heroku account (if needed)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Configure environment variables
   - Deploy automatically

3. **API Goes Live!** 🎉
   - Your API will be live at: `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com`
   - Can be accessed from anywhere
   - Shareable with friends/users

## 📌 Important Notes

- **Heroku Free Tier**: 
  - Free dyno hours (550/month)
  - Auto-sleep after 30 mins of inactivity (OK for dev)
  - Restart daily (data resets - use database for persistence)
  - Sufficient for testing/early users

- **This API**:
  - Converts HEIC files to JPG/PNG/JPEG
  - Supports quality control and resizing
  - Has user/quota system (database tracked)
  - Auto-cleans old files every 24 hours

- **Next Phase**: Stripe integration for monetization

**Status**: Awaiting GitHub repository URL from you!
